  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water (about 110°F / 43°C)</li>
    <li>2 1/2 – 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for drizzling)</li>
    <li>1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>8 oz (about 225 g) fresh mozzarella, sliced or torn</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>Grated parmesan (optional)</li>
    <li>Flour or cornmeal for dusting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast on top. Let stand 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
    <li>Mix 2 1/2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead ~6–8 minutes, adding a little flour if sticky, until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1–1.5 hours until doubled.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 475–500°F (245–260°C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it inside the oven.</li>
    <li>Punch down dough and divide (this makes two medium pizzas). Shape each portion into a round and stretch/roll to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a floured or cornmeal-dusted peel or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce, add mozzarella, and drizzle with a little olive oil.</li>
    <li>Bake 8–12 minutes (time depends on oven and thickness) until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven, top with fresh basil leaves and grated parmesan if desired. Slice and serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
